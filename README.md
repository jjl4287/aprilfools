# Spotify April Fools Prank

A simple prank webpage mimicking Spotify to surprise someone.

## Setup

1.  **Personalize:** Open `script.js` and change the `girlfriendName` variable to the actual name/nickname of the person you want to prank.
2.  **Customize Images (Optional):** Replace placeholder images in `index.html` (marked with `<!-- Placeholder -->`) with actual Spotify logos or playlist art if desired for better realism. You might need to search the web for suitable image URLs or download them.
3.  **Deploy:** Deploy this folder to a static web host like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel.

## How it Works

-   The page initially shows a fake Spotify playlist embed.
-   Clicking the embed reveals a fake Spotify UI.
-   After a short delay, JavaScript simulates adding Radiohead songs, creating playlists, and playing tracks via pop-up notifications and UI updates.
-   After a set duration, an "April Fools!" message is revealed with a link to the real Spotify.

**Note:** This prank is entirely client-side and does not interact with any real Spotify accounts or data.
